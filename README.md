# Stoner-Wohlfarth-Tutorial

This is a tutorial on how to calculate magnetisation curves for various materials using the Stoner-Wohlfarth model. The content is aimed at Materials Scientists and also serves as an introduction to Jupyterlab and programming with Python.

The 3 notebooks show various aspects of calculating Stoner-Wohlfarth curves and are designed to be read in order:

- SW_curves_1_single.ipynb
- SW_curves_2_multi.ipynb
- SW_curves_3_applications.ipynb

The folder 'resources' contains various test data sets and images which are used in the tutorial.
